    <h4> An extremely strong signal was detected by an extraterrestrial radar dish
      <br> monitoring the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The contents of which have
      <br> been transcribed below. It is unknown if this is a true alien transmission 
      <br> or a misidentified terrestrial radio signal.
      <br>
      <br> The contents of the document are under heavy scrutinization. The United
      <br> States Government will be monitoring the section of origin within the
      <br> Milky Way for any repeated radio signals.
      <br>
      <br> It is unknown why or how the signal is written in English.

   <h1> PART 1: WHY SHOULD I CARE? </h1>

  <h4> Recently, the Galactic Council has discovered a new planet with intelligent life, Earth.
    <br> However, currently, Terrans, the natives to Earth, are not welcoming to alien life
    <br>
    <br> But why should you go to Earth?
    <br>
    <br> Terrans are one of the most generalist species in the galaxy, their
    <br> phyiscal makeup is able to withstand extremely harsh environments
    <br> in comparison to the tolerance ratio of other galactic speices.
    <br>
    <br> This means that, once we form an alliance with them, we may
    <br> be able to utilize Terrans as scouts to planets otherwise
    <br> inhospitible.

    <h4>
      This is a Terran. Terrans are the native speicies of Earth. They are named after
      <br> the word for "Earth" in an ancient Terran language.
      <br>
      <br> Be careful near Terrans. Terrans in history have been extremely dangerous and
      <br> hostile towards others, including those within their own species. This is the
      <br> only recorded instance of intraspecies warfare in the known galaxy.
      <br>
      <br> Recommended gear when contacting Terrans:
      
      <ul>
        <li> Full protective suit </li>
        <li> High strength tranqualizers </li>
        <li> High utility first aid kit </li>
      </ul>
      
      <br> Do not attempt to make violent contact with Terrans in any way. As mentioned
      <br> above, Terrans are extremely hostile and have unlocked the power of the atom.
      <br> Contact with Terrans in general is largely discouraged.

    <h3> Seen above: A native predator to Earth
      <h4>
        Earth has many predators that call it home, however many
        <br> are often weaker than others. Seen above is a species
        <br> known as a "dog." Dogs used to be a different species
        <br> known as a "wolf," however, during their time on the
        <br> planet, Terrans have transformed the wolf species into
        <br> a more friendly variant that they keep within their homes.
        <br> 
        <br> There are, however, more dangerous animals on the surface
        <br> of Earth. For example, the family Ursidae, otherwise known
        <br> as bears, have been wholely unable to be tamed by Terrans,
        <br> and are instead considered to be dangerous to all, particularly
        <br> the sub-species, Ursus maritimus, who is considered one of the
        <br> most dangerous animals on Earth.

      <h1> PART 2: WHAT SHOULD YOU DO IF...? </h1>
    <h4> If you find yourself on Earth, do not panic! Relay to command and await
      <br> rescue. However, Earth poses many dangers, especially to those who are
      <br> not cautious. Therefore, the Galactic Council has prepared a chart that
      <br> instructs you what to do should you come across various Earth phenomina.
      <br>

      <table>

  <h1> PART 3: UTILIZATION </h1>
  <h4> As mentioned before, Terrans can be extremely useful in exploring newly
    <br> discovered planets within the galaxy. However, as of now, Terrans are 
    <br> not willing to accept alien life. The Cosmic Council has planned out the 
    <br> entire trajectory of Terran relations and utilization within the Galaxy:
    <ol>
      <li> Observe. We must fully understand the behavior of terrans in
        <br> order to attempt to make peaceful contact. </li>
      <br>
        <li> Make contact. Begin with peaceful comments. Do not appear as a
          <br> threat. </li>
      <br>
          <li> Develop. Terrans have only barely managed to reach space, and sustained,
            <br> quick missions are impossible for them. We will give them peices
            <br> of our technology, as well as our methods to create advanced space-
            <br> fairing vehicles. </li>
      <br>
            <li> Assimilation. At this point, the Galactic Council anticipates that Terrans
              <br> will be willing to join the Galactic Council. </li>
      <br>
      <li> Utilization. At this point, the Glactic council will request something from the
        <br> Terrans. Access to their weaponry.
        <br>
        <br> Terrans have found utilization for weapons that are capable of tearing cells apart
        <br> at the seams and causing lifelong debilitations. The Galactic council wishes to use
        <br> this technology in order to quell any uprisings or rebellions within the Galaxy. </li>
    </ol>
  </h4>
  
  <h1> PART 4: CLOSING REMARKS </h1>
  <h4> The future for Terrans and the Galaxy seems bright, but the road to assimilation 
    <br> will not be easy. Terrans already appear hostile towards outsider contact. And
    <br> the weapons utilized by Terrans have the potential to cause mass extinction. 
    <br> 
    <br> However, with your help, alongside the dilligent efforts from the Galactic Council,
    <br> we can use Terrans to make the Galaxy a better place.
