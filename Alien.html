  <h4> Recently, the planet Earth has been inducted into the intergalactic council.
    <br>  This means that we are now allowed to access the planet and speak with it's 
      <br> natives, Terrans, or, in their native tounge, Humans. 
    <br>
    <br> But why should you go to Earth?
    <br> 
    <br> Did you know that Earth is the galaxy's leading producer of Carbon?
    <br> It's true! There is more carbon on Earth than any other planet.
    <br> They have so much that it's even killing their planet. However,
    <br> we can help them.

    <h4>
      This is a Terran. Terrans are the native speicies of Earth. They are named after
      <br> the word for "Earth" in an ancient Terran language.
      <br>
      <br> Be careful near Terrans. Terrans in history have been extremely dangerous and
      <br> hostile towards others, including those within their own species. This is the
      <br> only recorded instance of intraspecies warfare in the known galaxy.
      <br>
      <br> Recommended gear when contacting Terrans:
      <br> Full protective suit
      <br> High strength tranqualizers
      <br> High utility first aid kit\
      <br>
      <br> Do not attempt to make violent contact with Terrans in any way. As mentioned,
      <br> Terrans are extremely hostile and have unlocked the power of the atom.
      <br> Contact with Terrans in general is largely discouraged.
