  <h4> Recently, the planet Earth has been inducted into the intergalactic council.
    <br>  This means that we are now allowed to access the planet and speak with it's 
      <br> natives, Terrans, or, in their native tounge, Humans. 
    <br>
    <br> But why should you go to Earth?
    <br> 
    <br> Did you know that Earth is the galaxy's leading producer of Carbon?
    <br> It's true! There is more carbon on Earth than any other planet.
    <br> They have so much that it's even killing their planet. However,
    <br> we can help them.

    <h4>
      This is a Terran. Terrans are the native speicies of Earth. They are named after
      <br> the word for "Earth" in an ancient Terran language.
      <br>
      <br> Be careful near Terrans. Terrans in history have been extremely dangerous and
      <br> hostile towards others, including those within their own species. This is the
      <br> only recorded instance of intraspecies warfare in the known galaxy.
      <br>
      <br> Recommended gear when contacting Terrans:
      
      <ul>
        <li> Full protective suit </li>
        <li> High strength tranqualizers </li>
        <li> High utility first aid kit </li>
      </ul>
      
      <br> Do not attempt to make violent contact with Terrans in any way. As mentioned
      <br> above, Terrans are extremely hostile and have unlocked the power of the atom.
      <br> Contact with Terrans in general is largely discouraged.

    <h3> Seen above: A native predator to Earth
      <h4>
        Earth has many predators that call it home, however many
        <br> are often weaker than others. Seen above is a species
        <br> known as a "dog." Dogs used to be a different species
        <br> known as a "wolf," however, during their time on the
        <br> planet, Terrans have transformed the wolf species into
        <br> a more friendly variant that they keep within their homes.
        <br> 
        <br> There are, however, more dangerous animals on the surface
        <br> of Earth. For example, the family Ursidae, otherwise known
        <br> as bears, have been wholely unable to be tamed by Terrans,
        <br> and are instead considered to be dangerous to all, particularly
        <br> the sub-species, Ursus maritimus, who is considered one of the
        <br> most dangerous animals on Earth.

  <h1> PART 3: FEELING SCARED? </h1>
  <h4> Who could blame you? from what has been outlined, Earth sounds like
  <br> a hostile place that is full of organisms that wish to kill you.
  <br> However, Earth is also a place of beauty. Across the planet, Terrans
  <br> have set up reserves known as "National Parks" where settlement is
  <br> banned. Within these parks can be seen some of the most remarkable
  <br> places in the universe.
  <br>
  <br> Remarkable National Parks include:
