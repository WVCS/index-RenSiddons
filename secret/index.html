    <h1 class="title"> Part 1: The Idea </h1>
    <h2 class="idea"> The idea of Britain simply putting all of their prisoners on an island and leaving them there makes almost no sense. Why not just build more prisons? Or start killing prisoners? </h2>

    <h2> Their accent is clearly just them speaking a British accent but trying to modify their accent (poorly) to try to avoid suspicion. </h2>

    <h1 class="title"> Part 3: The Wildlife </h1>
    <h2> How can someone be expected to believe that all these horrifying animals actually exist? All of these animals are surely made up so that nobody wants to go into Australia, where they would then learn that it is fake.</h2>

    <div id="why">
    <h1 class="title"> Part 4: Why? </h1>
    <h2> But why would anyone do this? Well, simply to be funny, of course. Someone out there wants the bragging rights of tricking the entire world into believing in the existence of an entire continent. </h2>

      <h1 class="title"> Part 5: But I've been to Australia </h1>
      <h2> If you think you've gone to Australia, you're sorely mistaken. Mostly, airliners just fly above the nearest ocean for a couple of hours before landing down in the nearest "Australia Zone", or a zone where actors are paid to make people believe they are in australia.

        <h2> Sorry buddy, that isn't your friend. It's simply an actor trying to fool you into believing in the lie that is Australia. Maybe they act like they're all friendly with you, but in reality they just want to propogate the lie and fool more people. </h2>
