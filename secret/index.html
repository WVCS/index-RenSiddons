    <h1 class="title"> AUSTRALIA IS <span class="fake"> FAKE </span> </h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle"> A comprehensive explanation of why Australia does not exist. </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title"> Part 1: The Idea </h1>
    <h2 class="idea"> The idea of Britain simply putting all of their prisoners on an island and leaving them there makes almost no sense. Why not just build more prisons? Or start killing prisoners? </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title"> Part 2: The "People" </h1>
    <h2> They're accent is clearly just them speaking a British accent but trying to modify their accent (poorly) to try to avoid suspicion. </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title"> Part 3: The Wildlife </h1>
    <h2> How can someone be expected to believe that all these horrifying animals actually exist? All of these animals are surely made up so that nobody wants to go into Australia, where they would then learn that it is fake.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="title"> Part 4: Why? </h1>
    <h2> But why would anyone do this? Well, simply to be funny, of course. Someone out there wants the bragging rights of tricking the entire world into believing in the existence of an entire continent. </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> This was a really stupid idea </p>
