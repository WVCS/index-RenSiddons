    <div id="about"> <h1 id="title2"> ABOUT FAZBEAR ENTERTAINMENT </h1> <h1> "Fantasy and Fun Come to Life." <br> <br> Fazbear Entertainment has lived by these words for almost 50 years. <br> And now, we bring you our most adventerous outing yet, Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex! <br> <br> But where did we start? Fazbear Entertainment was founded in the 80s by Henry Emily. Back then, the only animatronic we had was a yellow rabbit. <br> <br> From then, Fazbear Entertainment has only grown and expanded. However, poor health conditions and buildup of lawsuits caused Fazbear Entertainment to close down in the mid 90s. <br> <br> But we're back! <br> <br> And now, you can have fun, eat pizza, and stay at least 1 foot away from the animatronics at the Mega Pizzaplex. </h1> </div>

    <div id="feddy"> <center> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WVCS/index-RenSiddons/main/amusement/TEX_Poster_Freddy_figure.png" width="40%" id="gangs"> <p> Do we even need to introduce him? Freddy Fazbear has been the face of our company for 40 years, and he's gotten many makeovers. Now, he's inspired by 80s rockstars, with some moves even inspired by David Bowie. And when you think you know everything he's got, think again. Hiding in his chest is a compartment perfeclty suited to bring around oversized birthday cakes and presents, making Freddy the perfect animatronic for your child's birthday party.</p></center> </div>
    <div id="chick"> <center> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WVCS/index-RenSiddons/main/amusement/TEX_Poster_Chica_figure.png" width="33%" id="gangs"> <p> Chica the Chicken is another animatronic that came from the restructuring. Initially she was a part of her own restaurant, however she was added to the Freddy and Friends crew after Chica's Pizza World was bought out by Fazbear entertainment. Like Freddy, she's got an 80s rock makeover, and she still loves food, much like she always has. Be sure to check by Mazersize, an excersize program hosted by Chica.</p></center> </div>

Newly added to the team is Mongomery Gator, replacing Bonnie the Bunny as the new lead bassist. Never seen before his introduction to the Pizzaplex, Monty is quickly becoming a fan favorite.
