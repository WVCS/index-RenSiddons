    <div id="about"> <h1 id="title2"> ABOUT FAZBEAR ENTERTAINMENT </h1> <h1> "Fantasy and Fun Come to Life." <br> <br> Fazbear Entertainment has lived by these words for almost 50 years. <br> And now, we bring you our most adventerous outing yet, Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex! <br> <br> But where did we start? Fazbear Entertainment was founded in the 80s by Henry Emily. Back then, the only animatronic we had was a yellow rabbit. <br> <br> From then, Fazbear Entertainment has only grown and expanded. However, poor health conditions and buildup of lawsuits caused Fazbear Entertainment to close down in the mid 90s. <br> <br> But we're back! <br> <br> And now, you can have fun, eat pizza, and stay at least 1 foot away from the animatronics at the Mega Pizzaplex. </h1> </div>
