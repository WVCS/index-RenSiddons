  <div id="forward"><h1> FORWARD </h1>
<h2> There are many genres of video game, and different people may have different favorites, however, I am here to argue that survival games are objectively the best. </h2>  
</div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div id="macrogames"> 
    <h1 align="right"> WHAT ARE MACROGAMES? </h1>
      <h2> You may have heard of the term "minigames," which refer to smaller games within a larger game. For example, if an open world game has an arcade with playable cabinets, those are minigames. Microgames are games that last a few seconds at most, think of the warioware games. I suggest a new type of game, "macrogames." These are games that could theoretically be played forever. Some simple examples of macrogames are highscore based games, multiplayer games, and a lot of survival games. </h2></div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div id="survival"> <h1> WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT SURVIVAL? </h1>
    <h2> For the previous two examples above, it is easy to see why they are macrogames, high score based games have the sole goal of getting a higher score, and multiplayer games could have unique matches as long as there are players. But survival games oftentimes have final bosses, think the ender dragon in minecraft.
      <br>
      <br> But what you don't consider is the fact that there are often base building mechanics in survival games, and also they almost always utilize a system known as "seeds", or a string of characters that dictate how the world is set up. This means, unless you have astronomical luck, each world will be entirely different from the last. This means you could play the game essentially forever and always have a new experience.</div>
        </div>
    <br>
    <br>
  <br>
    <div id="Minecraft">
      <h1 align="right"> MINECRAFT </h1>
      <h2> Minecraft is my favorite game of all time, and I believe that this is because it perfectly encapsulates the macrogame energy. Of course because of all I talked about earlier, but also because of one thing, the blocks. See, in most other survival games, the way that someone would build a base is by using prefab building parts, giving some amount of freedom but still rather limited. However, Minecraft utilizes a system that I have only seen in one other survival game, blocks. Instead of having a "roof" peice, you can place many different things as a roof. Stairs, solid blocks, a flat top, and all in any shape you could possibly imagine. This even goes beyond houses, you can build truly extraordinary things in Minecraft, things that would be completley unimaginable in almost any other survival game.</h2>

  <div id="Subnautica">
    <h1> THE DOWNFALLS OF SUBNAUTICA </h1>
    <h2> By all accounts, subnautica is an amazing game. The world is vibrant, the animals unique, and the leviathan class lifeforms are terrifying. But one place where I believe the game falls flat is in the base building. The way the game handles base building is using a modular system, but it's far more restrictive than most other modular base building systems. Instead of getting a "floor" peice or a "wall" peice, allowing you to shape a room as your please, Subnautica gives you entire rooms that you can connect. Sure, there is still that sense of creativity in how you arrange these rooms, and what you put in them, but you will never get the freedom to truly make a base your own. </h2>
