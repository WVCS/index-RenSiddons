<b> Description: </b> PAROB 12 are a group of humanoid figures, completely white in skin tone, and completely lacking any body hair. PAROB 12 functions nearly identically to humans, with their own unique language, advanced technology, and advanced civilization. The main difference between PAROB 12 and humans is that PAROB 12 specimens do not require rest nor nutrition. PAROB 12 specimens have a demeanor similar to that of PAROB 1, being cold and unwavering. 
<br>
<br>
<b> History: </b> PAROB 12 was found during some of the first tests by the UN into alternate dimensions. They initially used PAROB 12 as a form of labor, since they lacked a need to rest or eat, however it was eventually deemed too inhumane to use them as labor, and they were released into a remote location in Africa.

<b> Description: </b> PAROB 13 describes a type of metal far stronger than any other material currently known to man. Parob 3 has a gray appearance with a slight thin-film interference. PAROB 13 is nearly indestructible, with the only thing seeming to be able to damage it is other instances of PAROB 13. PAROB 13 is also exceptionally malleable, until acted on by a large enough heat, as well as incredibly light, one of the least dense materials, within the 	10 lightest materials. These factors make PAROB 13 exceptional for armor, as well as replacements for steel and weapons. The primary downside is PAROB 13 is incredibly conductive, with a conduciveness comparable to that of water.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> History: </b> PAROB 13 was used by various governments as a type of armor and metal for 16 years, however, the conductive properties of PAROB 13 were then discovered, and time was spent developing and mass producing electricity based weapons, this caused PAROB 13 to become entirely ineffective as armor, as wearing it made you exceptionally weak to electric weapons. Afterwards, PAROB 13 was left simply to be used as a replacement for steel, until eventually falling completely out of use.

<b> Description: </b> PAROB 14 describes an engine located in an alternate dimension. Visually, it is not much larger than a car, dark gray in color and with an orange glow from within even when not active. PAROB 14 is capable of powering any vehicle or object without any required input, alongside 100% fuel efficiency in doing so. PAROB 14 also gives any vehicle using it the ability to travel faster than light.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> History: </b> PAROB 14 was discovered by the US government during the 1990s, the US continued to use it for many decades, until a set of raids by the ███████ ████ in 2036 targeted PAROB 14, leaving it in their hands. It is currently unknown what the ███████ ████ has done with PAROB 14, or if they have destroyed it.

<b> Description: </b> PAROB 15 is an alternate dimension created by the UN. PAROB 15 has the appearance of a massive, endless warehouse. The roof of PAROB 15 is roughly 15 feet tall and made of indestructible metal. The floor of PAROB 15 is made of similarly indestructible tiles.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> History: </b> PAROB 15 was created by the UN as an attempt to have one large storage location for anything that needs to be stored. However, before the UN could even begin to use it, a set of attacks by the ███████ ████ left the dimension in their control. The ███████ ████ have been using PAROB 15 as their home base for over 30 years, fiercely defending the location from roughly 5 attempts to reclaim it by the UN.
