    <h2 id="about">
     Hello. If you are reading this, then you are among the most trusted and high level people in the world. We are a group formed by the United Nations in order to keep their paranatural creations a secret. Mention of any dealings outside of the Department of World Secrecy is strictly forbidden, and can lead to prosecution, imprisonment, or even death.
<br>
<br>
The United Nations has done many things that the greater world is entirely blind to. Creations that could lead to victory in battles, immense technological advancements, or potentially the end of the world. But we are not alone. Another group, known as the █​​███████ ████ is fighting for control over these paranatural items, and attempting to use them for their own benefit.
<br>
<br>
Your job here will be to keep these paranatural objects - or PAROBs - a secret. Within this database, you will find a list of all known PAROBs that are unaccounted for, stolen, or went rogue. You will be expected to perform a large variety of tasks in order to keep the identity and existence of these objects a secret.
<br>
<br>
Depending on your job within the DWS, these tasks include, but are not limited to: <br>
Monitoring worldwide communications <br>
Entering the field to retrieve and destroy PAROBs <br>
Defending DWS research sites from █​​███████ ████ attacks
