<b> Description: </b> Appearing as a male human with a gray skin tone, PAROB 2 is most often seen hooked up to a variety of devices and computers, most connected to its brain. The cranial cavity of PAROB 2 is largely expanded from that of a normal human. PAROB 2’s eyes are entirely vestigial, with its eyes also adopting a gray color. PAROB 2 has a vastly increased mental capacity and far greater intelligence than is possible by any human. PAROB 2’s memory is also completely photographic, with it being able to remember and perfectly recreate an image seen for only a fraction of a second.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> History: </b> PAROB 2 was the first PAROB created directly by the UN. Created in 1946, PAROB 2 was created to store data without having to take up rooms entirely dedicated to servers. Headquartered within the UN headquarters in New York, PAROB 2 was utilized by the UN for over 50 years before suddenly gaining sentience and escaping the UN headquarters. PAROB 2 has not been seen since. PAROB 2 is considered to be a high priority target and is to be recontained at all costs.

    <div id="PAROB 3">
<b> Description: </b> PAROB 3 are visually nearly identical to the Western Honey Bee <i> (Apis mellifera) </i>, with the singular exception of being marginally larger, being similar in size to an average human thumb. PAROB 3 instances exhibit an enhanced rate and effectiveness of pollination over traditional <i> Apis Mellifera </i> instances. Instances of the Queen within colonies of PAROB 3 are far larger than would be expected, even given PAROB 3’s enhanced size, being close in size to an average car. Instances of PAROB 3 also have an extended lifespan, living for upwards of 10 years, as opposed to the roughly 2 months of typical <i> Apis Mellifera </i> instances. PAROB 3 is also able to construct far larger and far more complex structures that function as its hive.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> History: </b> PAROB 3 was created by the UN in 2010, shortly after the bee population began to decline. PAROB 3 was intended to fill the niche that would be left by the absence of bees, namely pollinating flowers. However, PAROB 3 instead created fortresses that were nearly entirely impenetrable. There are presently 4 of these fortresses known, with 2 having previously been penetrated and the PAROB 3 instances exterminated.

<b> Description: </b> PAROB 4 is a biological weapon that functions similarly to zombie viruses within popular media. PAROB 4 attacks the cells, causing them to rapidly decompose, including cells within the brain. PAROB 4 specifically attacks all brain cells with the exception of those that control aggression and strength. The result of this are creatures that have the appearance of a rotting corpse that is highly aggressive and dangerous.

      <br>
      <b> History: </b> Created by Russia during the Cold War as a weapon to be used would true war break out, PAROB 4 ultimately went unused. After the cold war ended, the UN learned about PAROB 4 and deemed it inhumane. PAROB 4 remained in storage for multiple decades, before a series of █​​███████ ████ raids left PAROB 4 in their hands. Battles between the UN and █​​███████ ████ lasted for several days, before PAROB 4 was released in a remote location within South America.
