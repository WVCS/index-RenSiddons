  <div id="body"> Eldritch Storm is a movement shooter most inspired by Ultrakill and set in the Cthulhu Mythos from HP Lovecraft. The player takes control of a private detective, killed by one of the Great Old Ones and revived by a patron god to fight on its behalf in a massive war between the Great Old Ones. The player will be sent to kill the other Great Old Ones which oppose their patron, but is their patron to be trusted? </div>
