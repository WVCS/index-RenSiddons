  <div id="body"> Road Rage is a simple game which I intended to be the first game that I would create, and although now it is the last one which I want to make, it still seems like a fun game to make. The player takes control of a man on a motorcycle rushing down a highway in the desert. The player will be confronted by armed enemies including other people on motorcycles, tanks, helicopters, and mechanical bosses. The player would be unable to stop moving, but would be able to slow down or speed up, as well as switch between different weapons. There is a chance this game wont get made, but I still want to keep it as an option in case I want to make something simple.</div>
