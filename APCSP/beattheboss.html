  <div id="body"> Beat The Boss is a rhythm boss rush game where the player needs to kill a list of bosses, all while keeping to the bpm of the song. The guise of the game is a competition where warriors and bounty hunters compete to see who is the best. The player will use a sword and a gun, and will also be able to equip special masks which give the player special abilities or modifications. Will you be strong enough to beat the boss, or will you fall into the backing track.</div>
